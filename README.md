Keywords: smart contracts; tokenisation; decentralised finance; immutable ledger; transparency in real estate transactions; security tokens.
Introduction:
Blockchain, as the name suggests it is referred to as the chain of blocks of 
information recording the transactions along with their unique characteristics. Each 
blockchain transaction is recorded and time-stamped and widely diffused with a unique 
symbol. Each block in the blockchain comprises a unique alphanumeric string generated 
by a hash function (public and private keys), a nonce (number specific to the block) and a 
hash function derived from the previous block. So, creating a new block will involve 
tampering with the previous block, which leads to maintaining the platform secure as it is 
impossible to tamper with the number of hash functions. 
Blockchain technology presents the absence of third-party participation, which makes 
this a decentralised ecosystem where users can interact without any barriers. Another 
additional feature is that there is no involvement of the central authority, which allows 
every user to verify and validate the state of transactions independently. Blockchain is the 
distributed public ledger for transactions, neglecting the necessity to trust the central 
authority. Instead, blockchain technology distributes the control among different nodes in 
the peer-to-peer (P2P) network. 

As we progress , the convergence of blockchain and real estate should be 
coupled with adopting InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), unlocking new opportunities. 
This platform delves into storing and saving property facts, figures, and images to IPFS 
for better management and legal compliance. Using a blockchain-based system, it also 
prevents fraudulent activities and non-duplication of a property to the same or different 
person. Each property would be represented by a unique digital token or smart contract 
on the blockchain containing all relevant information and ownership details. Smart 
contracts are self-executing contracts, bound by the agreement directly written in the 
code, automating and enforcing their execution. Smart contracts remove intermediaries’ 
participation, ensuring a transparent platform for the user. The integration of blockchain 
technology in this proposed system creates an ecosystem for transactions and automates 
processes through smart contracts.

FINANCIALIZATION OF REAL ESTATE THROUGH REITs

Real estate financialization refers to the process of integrating real estate assets into the global financial system, transforming
them from tangible properties into financial instruments that can be traded, securitized, and leveraged. The growing importance
of capital markets has driven this shift, along with the rise of institutional investment and the evolution of financial products that
connect real estate to these markets. As a result, housing and commercial properties are no longer viewed merely as physical
spaces but as assets capable of generating significant financial returns. This transformation has profoundly impacted how real
estate is valued, bought, sold, and managed. Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) are corporations that own, manage, or finance
income-producing real estate across various property sectors. These entities enable individual investors to purchase shares in
commercial real estate portfolios, thus democratizing access to large-scale, diversified real estate investments . The concept of REITs was established in 1960 under the Eisenhower administration, allowing for widespread public
participation in commercial real estate (Glascock and Lu-Andrews, 2014). REITs have significantly transformed the landscape of
real estate investment, making it accessible to a broader audience and impacting housing sectors globally. This democratization
has shifted the focus from direct housing investments to shared ownership through REITs, creating new investment
opportunities. During the 1960s, REITs were in their infancy, and a notable shift occurred in the 1980s toward mortgage REITs,
although these faced challenges by the end of the decade due to rising interest rates. The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility
Act of 1986 marked a significant turning point. It enabled REITs to manage properties directly, adopting a more active
management approach and transforming their role in the real estate sector. The 1990s saw explosive growth in REITs, with the
sector expanding from $8 billion to $50 billion and notable public offerings marking the beginning of the modern REIT era (Feng
et al., 2011). This period highlighted REITs' role in enhancing market liquidity, making it more resilient to economic fluctuations.
The introduction of innovative structures like UPREITs in the early 1990s further modernized the market by allowing property
contributions in exchange for operating partnership units, increasing flexibility in property management and investment.REITs'
resilience was tested during the market downturns of 1998–1999 and the global financial crisis of 2007–2008. Despite these
challenges, REITs were able to sustain and grow, partly due to their structure, which mandates significant payout ratios to
maintain investor confidence. The inclusion of REITs in the S&P 500 Index in 2001 underscored their importance in the financial
landscape, marking them as a viable and stable investment option
REITs have not only made investment opportunities in the housing sector more accessible, but they have also played a pivotal
role in shaping the modern real estate market. Their ability to adapt to economic changes and integrate new technologies
highlights their resilience and enduring relevance in the market..

SMART CONTRACT :
The Blockchain is known to be the distributed public ledger for all transac-
tions, eliminating the need of trust between the users and the central adminis-
trator and the control is distributed among different computers/nodes in the
peer-to-peer (P2P) network. Moreover, the Blockchain resolved the double-spend
problem using P2P technology in combination with public/private key crypto-
graphy.
Zhao
et al. [3] defined the Blockchain as “a distributed database comprising
records of transactions that are shared among participating parties”. According
to Deloitte [2] [4], Blockchain is “just another type of database for recording
transactions—one that is copied to all computers in a participating network”.
Blockchain by definition is a chain of blocks of information that registers
transactions with some characteristics. Each transaction conducted with Block-
chain technology is registered, time-stamped, and consecutively widely pub-
lished with a unique symbol. Transactions are inserted in the chain of blocks,
and each block is composed by a unique hash function (alphanumeric string re-
sulting from coding data with cryptographic private and public keys), a nonce (a
unique number to the block) and by a hash function from the previous block.
The first block is called genesis block. Therefore, an attempt to forge a block in-
volves the need to forge preceding blocks. This makes the mechanism safe and
secure from attempts to change a transaction.
Many people and researchers believe that blockchain applications in different
vertical industries could lead to three generations of the Blockchain, namely
Blockchain 1.0, Blockchain 2.0 and Blockchain 3.0. The Blockchain 1.0 is the
decentralization of money and payments and is used for digital currency. Fur-
ther, Blockchain 2.0 is used for smart contracts, assets, and properties. It is con-
sidered as the decentralization of finance. Moreover, Blockchain 3.0 is the de-
centralization of the digital society and is used for applications that relate to for
example to the Internet of things (IoT), health and government entities
Smart Contract Structure
Back to 1997, Nick Szabo [18] has introduced the term “smart contract”. A
smart contract is a code program identified by an address in the Blockchain
network. The main components of the smart contract are a set of executable
functions and state variables. Each transaction has input parameters which are
required a function in the contract. During the execution of a function, the sta-
tus of the state variables is changed depending on the logic implementation.
The smart contract code is written in high-level languages such as Solidity and
Python for Ethereum applications. The code is compiled into bytecode using
compilers as Solidity or Serpent. The contract code will be uploaded into the
Blockchain network once the compiler is executed without any errors. Each
contract will be assigned a unique address by the Blockchain network.
Any user in the Blockchain network can trigger the functions of sending any kind of transactions. The contract code is executed on each node member in the
Blockchain network as a part of their verification of new blocks.
Smart contracts deployed on a Blockchain network can send messages to oth-
er contracts. The message is composed by the address of the sender, the address
of recipient, value of transfer, and a data field which contains the input data to
the recipient contract. There is a difference between message and transaction, in
which transaction is produced by External Owned Account (EOA) while the
message is produced by a smart contract
Ethereum is one of the preferred technologies for the development of the
smart contracts. The main components for the transactions are based on state
machine and functions. It is a Turing-complete contract processing and execu-
tion platform based of a Blockchain decentralized shared ledger. The design and
the implementation of the Ethereum are totally independently from the crypto-
currency Bitcoin. A high-level programming language called Solidity is used to
write smart contracts and decentralized applications (Dapps). The programmer
can create their transactions formats, state transitions and events functions, and
rules for ownership. The software code is executed on virtual machine referred
to as the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)

Description:
 Real estate market has long faced several issues, including land title conflicts, a lack of transparency in property transactions, and fraudulent sales of the same land to multiple customers. Many residents struggle to check the legality of property titles, and procedures involving the Ministry of State Property, Surveys, and property Tenure are frequently lengthy, paper-based, and vulnerable to corruption or data loss. As a result, both domestic and international investors are skeptical about real estate deals.

LandLink aim to overcome these difficulties by creating a Blockchain-based Real Estate Marketplace DApp (Decentralized Application) that guarantees transparent, tamper-proof, and verifiable property transactions.This platform involves the sender, buyer, lender, and appraiser. They are defined in  different roles, such as: 
• sender lists property 
• the buyer deposits the amount for the property if selected 
• the lender approves, funds, transfer ownership 
• the appraiser determines the authenticated value of a property 
• seller gets paid. via smart contracts.
 
 LandLink is transforming  real estate operations by combining Web3 technology and distributed ledger concepts.

Problem Statement:
                 The real estate industry is known for its complexities, involving multiple intermediaries, 
time-consuming processes, and potential fraud risks. Standard real estate systems lack 
transparency and security for addressing these challenges efficiently.
                 
Countries like Cameroon's land registration system is centralized, with records stored in physical offices that are vulnerable to manipulation, fire, or theft. This leads to issues such as lack of transparency, land fraud, slow bureaucratic processes, limited access to trusted property data, and discouraged investment.
These issues not only limit citizens’ trust in real estate transactions but also  
discourage digital transformation and economic growth in the real estate sector.

 The problem statement explores the benefits of the convergence of blockchain 
into real estate for a more trustworthy ecosystem without the involvement of any central 
authority. This proposed system will prevent duplications of the property to one or the 
same person, initiating no confusion and a trustworthy bond between the seller and buyer. 
It will allow the smooth selling of the property as there is no involvement of third parties 
or any central authority. 
 
Many features have been added to this system. This platform will overcome the 
drawbacks mentioned and stand out from the current systems. The drawbacks are: 

• Data privacy: Personal information is securely stored and shared among authorised 
parties, maintaining user privacy. 
• Fair transactions: It comprises intelligent contacts for fair and unbiased property 
buying and selling transactions. 
• Transparency: Transparency is maintained by recording all the transaction details 
and allowing access to all the authorised members, like the buyer and seller. 
• Security: Security is maintained by keeping all the relevant information, like facts, 
figures, and amounts, in the IPFS so that no unauthorised party can tamper with the 
data. 
• Non-duplication of property: Each property is uniquely represented by smart 
contracts or blockchains’ unique tokenisation, making it impossible to duplicate or 
double-spend. 
• Immutable ownership records: Blockchain includes a permanent record of property 
ownership details to prevent disputes over the history of property ownership. 
• Enhanced trust: Trust is maintained for the user’s active participation without fearing 
fraudulent activities. Users can refer to the property records independently. 
• Real-time updates: The proposed system allows real-time updates on property 
listings and transactions, providing timely and accurate information from the sender, 
buyer, and lender. 

Other problem to solve ( In countries like Cameroon)

1. Manual property Records: The majority of property ownership records are still kept on paper, which makes them vulnerable to manipulation, loss, and physical harm.
2. Corruption and Fraud: Untrustworthy authorities frequently take advantage of centralized systems, which leads to multiple sales and forged ownership documents.
3. Lack of Transparency: There is no single, validated database of land records available to buyers and sellers.
4. Ineffective Bureaucracy: It might take weeks or months to finish property registration and title transfers.
5. Limited Accessibility: It might be challenging for residents in remote locations or overseas to obtain trustworthy real estate information. 

Suggested Resolution:
                     This proposed system focuses on developing a secure and user-friendly blockchain-based 
real estate website to facilitate property transactions and transfers. By leveraging 
blockchain technology, the platform aims to provide tamper-free ledgers, enhanced 
security measures, and transaction transparency. 

Approach:

• Design a user-friendly blockchain platform. 
• Utilise blockchain’s immutability for tamper-free ledgers. 
• Enhance security through encryption and multi-factor authentication. 
• Enable transparency via smart contracts and auditable transaction records.

Specific Objectives:

Create smart contracts for escrow management, ownership transfer, and property listing.
• Develop a Next.js frontend that allows users to interface with distributed storage and blockchain technologies.
• Use IPFS integration for decentralized document verification and storage.
For availability, performance, and scalability, make use of cloud infrastructure.
• Make it possible for citizens, agents, surveyors, and government representatives to collaborate with one another.
• Create distributed components that are fault-tolerant to guarantee dependability in the event of system or node failures.

Working of  Smart Contract :
1 .Interface definition: The contract defines NFT as a standard of the interface 
IERC721, following the ERC-721. It includes a transfer from function, which allows 
ERC721 tokens to be transferred from one address to another. 

2 .Escrow contract definition: The main contract is an escrow contract. State variables 
will also be included; they will store the address of an NFT contract, the address of a 
seller, the address of the inspector, and the address of the lender. The modifiers 
define who can perform certain procedures associated with particular employees’    
responsibilities, like only Buyer, Seller, and Inspector, through various mappings
that contain purchase price, escrow amount, buyer details, inspection status, and 
approval. 
 
3. Constructor: These create a contract where the owner’s NFT address, along with that 
for the seller, the inspector, and the lender, are mentioned. 
4. List function: One can, for instance, include details like NFT ID, Buyer’s address, 
purchase price, escrow funds and so on when selling an NFT. It facilitates the 
transfer of the NFT from the sellers to the escrow contract. State records relative 
information for a valid contact.

5. Deposit earnest function: The earnest money is placed in a special trustee escrow for 
specific NFTs. The function should be doing business, and the accumulated amount 
must equal or surpass a certain level under an escrow parameter. 
 
 
    
6.Update inspection status function: The inspector may include in his post a new 
inspection result for a specific NFT stating whether it is approved or rejected.
7. Approve sale function: Any specific NFT sale can only be approved using the 
services of a third party. These include the buyer, seller or even the lender.
8. Finalise sale function: The last function of the Smart Contract completes the sales 
procedure by verifying that the product was well examined and there is consensus 
among the parties involved. The platform sends money to the seller and sends NFT 
to the buyer.
9. Cancel sale function: If the inspector does not certify the item, the cancellation will 
be allowed with a full reimbursement for the buyer. Or the funds will be transferred 
to the seller if the inspection passes. 

10.Receive function: The function allows for payment in Ether and the contract accepts. 
11. Get balance function: It retrieves the current balance of the contract. 
Briefly, the code develops a secure escrow system for NFTs trade between buyers and 
sellers and inspectors. Some of its essential aspects include earnest money deposit, 
inspection status update, sale approval, finalisation of sales based on inspection results, 
and disapproving or cancelling a sale.

How It Operates:

1. Registration of Properties
By adding supporting paperwork to the site, property owners register their properties. To guarantee integrity, the document is kept on IPFS and its hash is entered into the blockchain smart contract.
2. Marketplace Listing
Properties are listed on the decentralized marketplace after registration. Through their MetaMask wallet, prospective purchasers may peruse listings, examine information, and start transactions.
3. Procedure for Transactions
In order to guarantee that money is kept safe until the seller certifies the transfer of property, buyers deposit money to a smart contract escrow.
4. Transfer of Ownership
The smart contract automatically updates the on-chain register and transfers ownership after successful verification. The transaction is kept on file forever.


Distributed and Cloud Characteristics:

Scalability, Fault Tolerance, and Collaboration

Scalability: LandLink is intended to grow horizontally by hosting blockchain nodes and related services across distributed cloud environments. As popularity rises, the system can accommodate more users and property listings while maintaining performance. Furthermore, incorporating sidechains (such as Polygon) ensures low-cost, high-throughput transactions.

Fault Tolerant: LandLink's blockchain network ensures that data is duplicated across numerous nodes, making it fault-tolerant. Even if one or more nodes fail, the system will continue to run without interruption. This decentralized design provides high availability and resistance to data loss or single points of failure.
The usage of a distributed ledger also reduces the time it takes to 
conduct due diligence and background checks (Torres and Brann, 2019). 
Veuger and Nijland (2019) articulated that having data in disparate 
databases increases delays in gathering information. Hence, storing data 
in a secured public location where each member has access is a potential 
solution to mitigate that problem.

The  Image  below displays how nodes access information in the blockchain. Each node can access the information contained in the ledger and all the nodes have access to the same information . World Bank  argued that the equality to the information in a distributed ledger eliminate the asymmetry of information, which can significantly reduce fraud in the real estate sector. Mashatan and Roberts  also stressed that equal access to the information can reduce the risks of impersonation in real estate. In the same paper, they also highlighted the lack of transparency in the bidding process, which gives sellers a competitive edge at the expense of buyers. As they argued, in the bidding process, the only source of buyers to get information is through the sellers. Thus, the sellers may only release information if they regard them to work on their advantages. They suggested that keeping bidding information in a decentralized location would allow buyers to access the bidding information, which increases fairness and transparency. Corluka and Lindh also emphasized that the lack of transparency in the real estate sector about the properties information impairs the decision making of investors, which increase speculative activities. Therefore, the use of a distributed database about the properties information may allow investors to take better decisions.
<img width="945" height="682" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3139988-63ae-497e-a6b1-8170dcfe4c60" />

 

Collaboration: The platform fosters collaboration among many parties, including landowners, purchasers, government officials, surveyors, and notaries, via a shared and trusted ecosystem. Each participant has open access to property information, allowing for collaborative decision-making and speedier verification.
A blockchain is a decentralized database that is disseminated and propagated across the matrix of peer-to-peer
computer nodes that constitute the blockchain. A blockchain, such as a database, stores information electronically in
digital format. However, unlike a database blockchain-based system keeps track of transactions in a secured and
decentralized manner. The blockchain's breakthrough is that it ensures the accuracy and security of a data record
while also generating trust without the requirement for a trusted third party. The level of accuracy and security is
achieved by the distribution of access control over the multiple nodes present in the network. Moreover,
Blockchain-based Bitcoin is regarded as a pioneer to solve the double spending problem by implementing a
universal ledger system.
In essence, the digitalization of Real Estate, such as other domains, improves flexibility, effectiveness, and
accountability for one of the significant international investment options. The introduction of blockchain technology
has recognized and addressed some of the most prominent fundamental challenges in RE due to the disadvantages
that come with the current centralized database-based system.



Mechanisms of Security
• Blockchain immutability: Prevents ownership history from being changed.
Secure and verifiable transactions are guaranteed via wallet-based authentication.
• Smart Contract Validation: This feature automatically upholds the terms of agreements.
The presence of a high number of intermediaries in the transaction process raises the costs and delay in finalizing the deals. The application of a smart contract can allow a direct transaction between transacting parties with no need of a third party. As we defined above, a smart contract is a block of lines of code, which are executed when the pre-defined conditions are met . In our proposed solution, these smart contracts can be effective if there is a distributed database to keep all the records. As an example, a buyer would first check the properties information which may include the last maintenance, the price, size, etc; and since these will be publicly available in the database, the access should be easy. Once, the buyer satisfies the conditions set by the seller, the transfer ownership of the property should happen automatically. Not only that automation eliminates the need for a third party, but it will also reduce the transaction time.
<img width="945" height="273" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6dd3a0d9-adfe-4b2f-b5e6-f7aba6619b4a" />

 
Smart contract is also an efficient way to speed up the transaction process. Before the smart contract is approved, the parties involved in the transaction are directly authenticated . The authentication is performed by the system by using the already recorded information of the participating parties. This automation greatly reduces delays caused by traditional manual checking of documents .
Data integrity:
 a.Proof of work: The system generates a target hash for miners. Once 
the hash is found and the other nodes have validated it, the block is 
added  in the ledger and the miner gets rewarded for his effort; hence 
the name ‘proof of work’. The proof of work makes the attack by 
hackers very expensive due to a high consumption power

b.Hashes connectivity: The inter-connection of 
blocks. Each block contains some sorts of data, its own hash and the 
hash from previous block. Therefore, a small change in one block 
affects the whole chain. This method protects against the tampering 
of data. By applying this method to real estate would diminish the 
number of frauds mainly committed through the illegal title transfers 
and titles modifications .
<img width="945" height="519" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f283d31f-943c-4906-b0ec-92281443e1ad" />
 

Tokens:
Tokenisation is a method that can enable investors to own fractional 
ownership in a property. The process of issuing tokens may take a form 
of the Initial Public Offering (IPO) applied in the stock market . The owner of the property may issue tokens 
based on the market value of the property and sell them to potential 
investors. This will allow investors who can’t afford to buy a property on 
their own to invest in the real estate sector. Additionally, as companies 
issue shares to grow, the sold of tokens may also allow owners to raise 
funds in developing or expanding their properties instead of taking a 
loan in the bank which carries some level of interest rates. Therefore, 
the use of tokens may effectively respond to the issue of liquidity in the 
real estate sector.
<img width="873" height="425" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f859ef4-8973-4a7f-8e83-a3f13cbc833f" />

 
THE GROWING TREND OF TOKENIZATION IN REAL STATE THROUGH BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY:
Issuing digital tokens on a blockchain represents full or fractional ownership of physical real estate assets, enabling buying,
selling, and trading on digital exchanges. This innovation lowers the barriers to real estate investment, allowing investors to
participate with smaller capital. Tokenization emerged with blockchain technology, enhancing transparency, security, and
transaction immutability. Tokens can be classified as digital currencies (e.g., Bitcoin), utility tokens
(used within a network), and security tokens (representing investment contracts like real estate, securities, and
commodities).Tokenization can be seen as the financial fractionalization and digitalization of real estate. Traditional real estate
investment has already undergone changes with products like REITs and timeshares. The main advantage of tokenization is its
efficiency, facilitated by Ethereum-based smart contracts that automate transactions without intermediaries . This technology reduces transaction costs and makes real estate investing more
inclusive and affordable . The process of housing tokenization includes selecting
assets, establishing legal frameworks, creating digital tokens from fractional ownership units, and listing them in Initial Coin
Offerings (ICOs). Once issued, tokens can be traded on secondary markets, providing higher liquidity than traditional properties.
Token holders can engage in governance and profit-sharing through smart contracts and Decentralized Autonomous
Organizations (DAOs) . Real estate tokenization practices gained momentum around 2017, with
platforms like Propy and Atlant exploring fractional ownership to address market inefficiencie. Between 2019 and 2020, advancements in blockchain led to the creation of Title Tokens, which store ownership
information on the blockchain. By 2020, platforms such as BrickX (Australia), Kasa (South Korea), and ADDX (Singapore)
demonstrated benefits like increased liquidity and lower costs, while also presenting new regulatory challenges (Chow and Tan,
2022).Institutional investors are increasingly recognizing the unique advantages of tokenization in real estate financing and
portfolio management, with evidence suggesting that tokenized assets offer distinct risk-return profiles attractive for
diversification . The shift from REITs to tokenized offerings is exemplified by the Aspen St. Regis Resort, which
transitioned to digital token issuance. The regulatory environment is evolving, with clearer guidelines such as Germany’s
Electronic Securities Act of 2021 supporting investment in this emerging asset class
